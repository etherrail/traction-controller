# EtherRail Traction Controller 1000D8SP
The WiFi based controller for locomotives and other rolling stock.
This device is a drop in replacement for any DCC boards.

Main Features
- WiFi enabled
- Fits PluX16S bounds (currently only NEM 652 connector)
- Up to 800mA current (1500mA peak)
- Track power probe
- Adaptive motor voltage capping
- 3â‚¬ production cost

## Track Power Probe
The traction controller constantly measures the track voltage. 
This can be used to monitor the tracks quality and schedule maintenance before issues arise.

## Technical Capabilities
The processor used on this device (ESP32C3) is more than capable for this task.
We could easily add sound or even camera functionality with this chip!
